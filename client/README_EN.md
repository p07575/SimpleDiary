## This is a simple diary application that can connect to a server, write posts, and view posts. The code is written in Python and uses several libraries such as keyboard, time, colorama, socket, and rsa. The application uses RSA encryption and decryption to ensure the security of user data.

## The code starts by defining a connServer class that is used to keep track of the connection status, host, port, username, password, and session key. The menu() function is used to display the main menu and the different options that the user can choose from.

## The ConnectServer() function is used to connect to the server. It first prompts the user to enter the server's IP address or domain name and port number. It then asks the user to enter their username and password. The function then sends an RSA public key to the server and receives a public key in return. The user's username, password, and public key are encrypted using RSA encryption and sent to the server. If the login is successful, the session key is extracted from the server's response and saved in the sc.sessionKey variable.

## The post() function is used to send a post to the server. It takes the title, name, content, and session key as parameters, concatenates them into a string, and sends them to the server.

## The get_post() function is used to retrieve posts from the server. It takes the name of the user as a parameter and sends a request to the server to retrieve the user's posts. The server responds with the requested posts, which are then displayed to the user.

## The sm() function is used to create and send a new post to the server. It prompts the user to enter the title and content of the post, and then calls the post() function to send the post to the server.

## Finally, the code generates a RSA key pair and calls the menu() function to display the main menu.
